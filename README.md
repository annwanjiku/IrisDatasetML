### THE IRIS DATASET
The iris dataset is a dataset of 150 entries without null values.
An Iris is a genus of about 300 species of plants.In this specific dataset we focus on 3 flowers: **Virginica**,**Versicolor** and **Setosa** each with 50 entries.
There are 5 columns Sepal length and width,Petal length and width and the specie for each of the 4 features.
The aim is to practice visualizations and Machine learning concepts.

## For this project
1.Install jupyter notebook
2.Load the dataset from _kaggle_ or from _sklearn_ as below:
`from sklearn import datasets
iris = datasets.load_iris()`
3.Import the necessary libraries:
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
* **Seaborn**: For simplified, informative statistical plots.
* **Sklearn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
4.Perform visualizations
5.Create models
6.Report findings

The findings of this project can be found in the jupyter notebook
